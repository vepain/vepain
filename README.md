👋 Hello!

I'm [Victor](https://vepain.gitlab.io/), 
* 🖥️ I am a computational biologist, and will join the University of Milano-Bicocca as a postdoc researcher.
* 🧬 I like [graph algorithms](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03815190), [integer linear programming, genome assembly](https://almob.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13015-023-00243-1) and FOSS! 
* 🎹 [I also play the piano](https://www.youtube.com/@professeurchep) (improvising is really funny!) 

The majority of my coding participations are on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/vepain), although I have a github account.
